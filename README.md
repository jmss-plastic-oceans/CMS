# Content Management System

**The hosted CMS service by sanity.io lets us have an interface to change the content on the website without having to know how to code.**<br>

## How to use
1. Go to [the CMS console](https://plastic-oceans-jmss.sanity.studio)
2. **If you haven't already**, create an author profile by clicking Authors then the + sign on the top right.
3. Go to the Posts section and press the + to make a new post.
    - Fill in all the fields, putting your author profile in the Author field.
    - Generate the 'Link slug' field by clicking 'Generate'
    - Click 'Publish' when you are done.
